ColorBuddy is a tool that allows designers to understand how to make their designs more inclusive to people who have different types of color-blindness. Through ColorBuddy, we specifically show designers what their chosen colors look like to people with red-green and blue-yellow color-blindness, as well as monochromacy. 

Once designers input an RGB value, ColorBuddy will first provide them with visuals of how their inputted color appears to those with color-blindness.
